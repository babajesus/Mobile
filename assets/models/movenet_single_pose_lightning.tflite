# This is a placeholder file for the MoveNet AI model
# In production, you would download the actual model from TensorFlow Hub
# 
# To get the real model:
# 1. Go to https://tfhub.dev/google/movenet/singlepose/lightning/4
# 2. Download the .tflite file
# 3. Replace this file with the actual model
#
# For now, the app will work with mock AI analysis
